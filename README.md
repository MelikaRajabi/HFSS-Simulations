# HFSS-Simulations
This repository contains some simulations in HFSS software: 
1. WR-90 Waveguide
2. RG-405 Coaxial Cable
3. Bethe Hole Directional Coupler: The r0 and s of the hole were chosen so that the Coupling factor equals 30 decibel and S(4,1) = 0, then added another hole and observed the results.
